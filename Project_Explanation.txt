
Insight Policy Change workflow

i have worked on workflow concept for Insight policy change.
we have a problem that is we faced some exception on that functionality because of that icustomer were being  charged multiple times that particular policy has not or cannot even bound .
So we choosen the solution by adding the condition of  the cancel or bind step to 
check for preemption activity.
if check find if it find the any preemption activity then it will send the preemption activity and  cancel the workflow
if check doesn't any activity then it will bound the workflow.

general:
effdatebranch to find the past time and effective time
Basedon = Pervious version of the entity
slicemode = viewing policy date in specified date in effective time.
sliceview = branch.slicedate.

window mode = view all version of  policy date  in effective time.
vehicle.allversion
modeltime= time period where job is bounded.
effective time = time dimension of the policy itself within the policyperiod.

Activity Pattern
Short Subject :A brief description of the activity Pattern
Email template - Email template to display if you select this activity
Escation days- no of days from the Escalation start days
Escalation hours - No of days from the Escalation Start date
prority-high,low,medium,top
targetdays-The number of days from the targetstartpoint to set the activity’s Target Date.
targethous -The number of hours from the targetstartpoint to set the activity’s Target Date.

Webservice-
DTO:
In Gosu ,If we we want to create a DTO we want to create a class that must decalred as final 
and Add @wsiExportable annotation.

So the @wsiExportable can be used for the both the request and response classess.
Soapwebservice:
SOAP - simple object access protocol.
WSDL - Webservice Description language
SoapWebservice is a collection of open protocol they are :
html, java,wsdl,xml
communiation is synchrounous.

Consuming the webserve:
if u are consuming the webservice from the claimcenter app
and calling from the external app
Gosu were deserilizating that request in gosu object
so that you Gosu code can access.

Fist of all you have to create the package for webservice collection:
create a new web service collection-gsrc.productcode.websercice.function name
fetch the resources-
specify the url 
Regenrate the xml classes
Reference the webservice collection in 
gosu
Reference to new api instance.
create a new instance of the api, add the properties which are available in the api like username and password
and call the methods in there with the parameters that you want.


Publising the Webservice:
For u are using publising the webservice you were serilizing the 
parameters into flattern form to send to api.
Here request are synchrounous

Create a package for webservice-
Create a gosu api class-
where we add @wsiwebservice annotation
create a gosu class for return type(if necessary)-
we add @wsiExportable annotation to specify that the class is serilizable
final keyword specified that cals can't be subtyped
we can use the bundles in webservice by calling the runwithnewbundle block to commit the data to entity.
gwb genwsilocal for generating local wsdl for all webservice
Restart the server-

  
  


Renewal Externalization:
So i was worked on the Home Product on that which mainly comes under the renewal policy.
Extternalization is the proces where we using Light weight rating method.
Here we used the Quotemodel consist of Light weight pogo classes to achieve better performance compared
to Guidewire entity model.classes of Quotemodel conist of Inheritance concept.

polaris and Earnix and IHP:
we were created payloads for request.
P is responsible for calculatinng insurance products and other terms and condition.
It supports all line of buisness such as car, home, van and bike.

Earnix is the Optimization engine which is used to calculate the discounts and commision 
based net quote rate provided by previous polaris response.

IHP is used for net primeium

After we creating this payload we saved this payload in the database to
check the structure of the request.






A web service can accept a Gosu object as an argument. It can also return a Gosu object. Such an object passed by a
web service between remote processes is often referred to as a data transfer object or DTO.

here we response after some rating and pricing which is happening on externalapp
consuming the other webservice:
Suit-cofig.xml-used to config other insurancesuite application 
wsimport WSDL_LOCATION_URL -s SUBDIRECTORY_NAME---used for java intellij
gwb genWsiLocal-For testing purposes only, the local files must be rebuilt by running the following command
from the PolicyCenter installation directory.
@WsiExportable - Add this annotation on a Gosu class to indicate that it supports serialization
with web services.
Seriliazation- new seerilization{
sort = true- match the order of the element that match the existing the xml 
validation = true-validate the xml against the xml documentation
}
Gxoption that change the xml export behavour

consuming external webservice:
// Set the web service endpoint URL for the web service WSDL
var urlStr = "http://www.aGreatWebService.com/GreatWebService?wsdl"
// Set the location in your file system for the web service WSDL
var loc = "/wsi/remote/GreatWebService"
// Load the web service WSDL into Gosu
Wsdl2Gosu.fetch(new URL(urlStr), new File(loc))

plugin:
From a technical perspective, PolicyCenter defines a plugin as an interface, which is a set of methods that are
necessary for a specific task
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Batch Process:
Batch process is the background process that depend on independent user
two types of batch
custom,predefined

custom Batch process:
batches which is defined by integration developer

for creating the batch process we need four steps
they were:
1.First step is creating a new typecode in batchprocess process typelist
2.in that batchprocess, i have to create a new class which extends the batchprocessbase class
there only method we override dowork method . there only we add the logic which takes no argument and perform the batchprocess
the batch class ends with []batch name
3. After that we want to reference our typecode in the processplugin class which implements Iprocessplugin we add that typecode inthe createbatchprocessmethod which is overrided from the iprocssplugin
4.Final step is configure the  scheduconfig xml file

properties that we can override from the Batchprocessbase class are :

1.type-returns the type of the batchprocess process
2.Operation Expected: Returns a count about how many operation that expects the batch process to perform as an integer.
3.operation completed- returns the count of total operationcompleted for the batchprocess.
4.CheckIntialCondition- this method is always returns true. That the intention of the method to check the environment server condition
examples set server run level as maintainance only. We should not manually return false to this method. it will affect the runlevel of the 
batch process.
5. getdescription- return the description the batch process.
6.incrementOperationsComplete()- count the number of the opertion which are executed during the 
for example : whenever you modify the entity those time you want to check the process of the operation.
7.incrementOperationsFailed- this property returns the reason why the operation failed. it stores
the reason in the operationfailed array propery.
8. SetchinkingbyId-using a series of separate quries in chuck, rather than retrieving all the queries 
in a masive block.
parameters were query and batachsize
9.requestTermination-  whenever you click the stop button the batch get stooped by calling  
this method It defaults return false. we ensure dowork method check this method frequently
10.Exclusive- determine whether another instance of this batch is running while  this process is running
if you want to run multiple instance set this method to false

Scheduling the Batchprocess
processschedule- describes which batch process to execute
croneschedule- it is the child element which describes when batch process run.
maintanancetoolapi.startbatchprocess("processname")

nocurrentle bundle block is used in batchprocess instead use the runwithnewbundle block

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
predefined:
Already configured batch process
example: 
Renewal start


Messaging Events:
you can send the message to the external system if something changes in the policycenter
such as changed policy, it would trigger the event and sent the message to the external system.
for example if you submit a new policy, you messaging code notifies a billing system about the 
new policy.

Event-if the entity type is defined as <event> tag  it trigger an event if a user click the 
changed the application data or api the changed the data.

After the event is trigerred, A call made to Event fire rule ,
there we creating a Message payload is created, it is form of string.

After the message is sent and all message object are changed into 
Message History object.

Message Destination:
it an external system to send message 
it represent a single message 
it is registered a Studio
  
Root object
the root object for the event is the entity instance
root object is same as the root object of the event that triggered 
the event fire rule within which you created the message.

Acknoldgement:

this represents that response from the external system
_ and + acknoldgement

error represent network problem
when we get nak acknoldgement we are not able to resend the message.
 
Safe ordering:
it is nothing but it orders the message based on the time of creation of message 
A messages with object without the primary object is considered as the non-sfe ordering message


Message Request plugin-performs the message preprocessing
company-appcode-messaging.functionalarea
messageRequestinterferce->beforesendmethod->we have to pass message object
message Transport plugin - performs the message trasnsport
message reply plugin - performs the message reply


before send method:-->Request Plugin
here if we want format payload before sending to the external system, we need this method

Transport Plugin is strictly required
there we use the send method.

Restriction in message creation in entity:
do not add api call to change the entity data
never delete the object

Event fired rule
four rule sets
This rule is execute whent event entity in triggered

Preupdate rule

Rules execute when update occurred on root entity

validation
rules checks if the missing data on a root entity.


 
 
 overall explanation about the message:
 During Apllication starts,when user changes the data which is event entity and 
 or api changed the event entity,it fires the event fire rule after that corresponding event entity
 it creates a new message payload whihc is in the form of text based and add that payload in the
 message send queue databse.
 message send queue is nothing but it dispatches message from the message plugin 
to send them to the external system.
based on the request we get positve and negtive acknoldgment.

Fundamentals of guidewire

Validation:

UI Screen:
It is used to prevent the user to enter the wrong data.
it guides the user to enter the data in right format.
elements:
Input mask
Regular Expression

Entity screen:
in the datamodel we do the validation usig the valdaterxml file
there we add validation definition.
And in the entity we have to right click and select column param category and add validate type
this helps prevents the usser to enter the wrong data

we have validation rules for complex condition  which is
implemented in Gosu Rule.

we implement this using the delegate method
for that we have add  validable delegate
we have enable cheeckbox of the subtype entity trigger validation category.

List View:
List view is used to view the collection of multiple object
at same time.
it uses the row iterator and renders the object as each one row.
by using addto and removeto to add and remove datas
values
valuetype
elementname
editable

Listview is used in screen using panelref

If you set editable property to true for row iterator
then you don't need to set the editable property to
true for all widjet and row 

exposeiterator is defined
toadd and tooremove
we also learned the sorting method

@@@@@@@@@
Typelist
it is a predefined list of values,
typically used as dropdown

Typefilter:
it defines the subset of typecodes

popup
popup screen comes under the location group
it is return to the original location once the
popup is closed.

inputset:
cannot have toolbar,input column
organize the group of atomic widget

Partial Page update:
has two types ->Data only and Layout re-render
